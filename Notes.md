This applications is meant to showcase not only my web development fundamentals but also my ability to learn new technologies. Here I'm learning and utilizing the new feature of Rails 7, Hotwire and its two main components: Turbo and Stimulus.

Turbo helps to bring the Single Page Application feel to a project by intercepting requests and rendering only parts of the page.

Turbo Drive: accelerates links and form submissions by negating the need for full page reloads

Turbo Frames: decompose pages into independent contexts, which scope navigation and can be lazily loaded

Turbo Streams: deliver page changes over WebSocket SSE, or in response to form submissions using just HTML and CRUD like actions

Admin Dashboard: 
Have to figure out a way to easily create an admin, maybe through a mailer?

Admin Dashboard should have all the products, a list of users, a list of orders, and graphs for orders!
